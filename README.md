# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

**My personal notes and practice code while learning Python — from the basics all the way to OOP, regex, SQLite, Flask, and an intro to AI & Data Science.**

## 📖 What is this?

This repo is a running log of my Python learning path. Each folder is a topic, numbered in the order I studied it, and every file is a small, self-contained script with comments explaining the concept plus short examples and output — no fluff, just working code you can read top to bottom.

---

## 🧭 How it's organized

The core idea: **numbered topic folders = a linear curriculum.** Start at `01` and work your way up, or jump straight to whatever you're trying to learn.

| | Topic folders (`01`–`19`) | Mini projects (`20`) | Assignments |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What's inside** | One concept per file, with comments + examples | Small complete apps combining several concepts | Extra practice matched to a topic folder |
| **Best for** | Learning / reviewing a single concept | Seeing concepts used together | Testing yourself after a topic |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner → advanced, in order | Beginner → intermediate | Varies by folder |

## ▶️ Running the code

Most files are standalone scripts — no project-wide setup needed:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd python-learning-journey
python 01-basics-and-syntax/01-arithmetic-operators.py
```

Some folders need extra packages (Flask, Selenium, Pillow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib). Install what a given file imports, e.g.:

```bash
pip install flask selenium pillow numpy pandas matplotlib
```

The `19-ai-and-data-science/notebooks/` files are Jupyter notebooks — open them with:

```bash
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- Some scripts reference local file paths (e.g. `C:\Users\...`) from when they were written and tested on a local machine — they're kept as-is for learning reference.
- A couple of original files were blank in my notes and were left out of this repo.
- Assignments are organized by the topic they follow, not by number order — check the folder name to match it to its topic.
